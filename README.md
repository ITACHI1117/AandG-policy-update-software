# Project Dependencies

This README.md file provides an overview of the dependencies required for your project, which include `ttkbootstrap`, `customtinker`, and `Selenium`. These dependencies are essential for the successful development and functioning of your project. Below, you will find information on how to install and use these dependencies in your project.

## `ttkbootstrap`

**ttkbootstrap** is a Python library that extends the capabilities of the standard Tkinter library by providing a collection of Bootstrap-themed widgets. This library allows you to create modern and visually appealing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for your Python applications.

### Installation

You can install `ttkbootstrap` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install ttkbootstrap
```

### Usage

To use `ttkbootstrap` in your project, import it into your Python code like this:

```python
import ttkbootstrap as ttk
```

Once imported, you can use `ttkbootstrap` widgets to create stylish and customizable GUI components in your Tkinter-based applications. Refer to the [official documentation](https://ttkbootstrap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for detailed usage instructions and examples.

## `customtinker`

**customtinker** is presumably a custom library or module that you've created or are using in your project. It's not a widely known or standard library, so you should provide specific instructions on how to obtain and use it.

### Installation (if applicable)

If you have a separate module or library called `customtinker`, please include installation instructions here. For example:

```bash
pip install customtinker
```

### Usage

Provide clear and concise instructions on how to use `customtinker` in your project. Include code examples, if necessary, to demonstrate its usage.

## `Selenium`

**Selenium** is a powerful tool for browser automation, which can be used to control web browsers programmatically. It's a crucial dependency if your project involves web scraping, automated testing, or any other web-related tasks.

### Installation

You can install `Selenium` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

### Usage

To use `Selenium` in your project, import it into your Python code like this:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
```

You will also need to download the appropriate web driver for the browser you intend to automate (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge). Refer to the [Selenium documentation](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) for detailed usage instructions, examples, and information on web driver installation.

## Example Usage

Here's a simple example of how you can use `ttkbootstrap`, `customtinker`, and `Selenium` in your project:

```python
import ttkbootstrap as ttk
import customtinker
from selenium import webdriver

# Your code using ttkbootstrap, customtinker, and Selenium goes here
```

Remember to include any specific information, configuration options, or usage guidelines related to these dependencies that are relevant to your project.
